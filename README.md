## Hi there! 👋

<details close><summary>About myself ❓</summary>
Here you are on my Github you won't find much of interest but I hope you will like my evolution!
Otherwise I am an ancient student at 42 school. I am the kind of person who loves datacenters, which have always fascinated me, so I am also very interested in sysadmin and networks.

* What I'm learning now :
  * Python for scripting things. <img height="18" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg">
  * Language C just for fun. 🔎
  * And all things for sysadmin / networking. 📡
  
* Environment :
  * Arch Linux btw. <img height="18" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/linux/linux-original.svg">
  * Visual Studio Code because I am lazy. <img height="18" src="https://github.com/Aptura/Aptura/blob/master/img/icons8-visual-studio-code-2019.svg">
  * Termius for the GUI. 📡

* Work on :
  * <a href=https://github.com/Aptura/Dakky>Dakky</a>, my dear beloved ♥
  * On my own homelab diy. 🔒

I hope you will appreciate my evolution and that we will work together one day! ✌️
